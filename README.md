## This is bolierplate project for for a node/express app with grunt, livereload and ejs templates. 

##Todo
### For some reason ejs seems to be needed to be installed by npm install ejs even though it's in package.json... don't know why right now.
### Another problem is that npm install grunt-sass must also be run separately.

##Running
### App can be started by running node app.js
### Enable live reload by running grunt watch in another terminal...
